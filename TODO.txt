- make libixplog/ixpdict static? might not be possible since plugins have them as dependencies
- unit tests for libixpdict before I star messing with it, including memory usage and search efficiency, already have something with testBeolingus in dicttool to get me started
- optimize libixpdict, reduce memory usage, implement search indices
- Android version

old:
- ability to deactivate plugins in settings
- clear dict result table after switch between languages
- store column widths of tables in QSettings
- word search click - most of this stuff belongs in the dictionary search function, not in the UI code
- undo button in database manage panel?
- find button in dictionary to search in dictionary search results
- grab focus to appropriate line edit in database-popped dialogs
- keep window size in settings (maximized status too?)
- facilitate clipboard search
- set text interaction flags to 'selectable by mouse' on some qlabels
